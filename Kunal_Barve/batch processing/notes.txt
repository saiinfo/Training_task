netstat is a command-line network utility tool 

Active TCP connections (netstat -a)
Active TCP connections with IP addresses and port numbers (netstat -an)
Active UDP connections (netstat -u)
Network statistics (netstat -s)
Routing table (netstat -r)
Listening ports (netstat -abn)



@echo off: This command disables echoing of commands in the command prompt window. It ensures that only the output of the executed commands is displayed, without showing the commands themselves.


cls: This command clears the screen, ensuring a clean output window before displaying the IP addresses and ports.

echo Local IP addresses:: This line displays the text "Local IP addresses:" in the command prompt window.

ipconfig | findstr /R "IPv4 Address": This command executes the ipconfig command, which displays information about the current IP configuration. The output of ipconfig is then piped (|) to the findstr command, which searches for lines containing the text "IPv4 Address". This effectively filters the output to display only the IPv4 addresses assigned to the local machine.

echo Available ports:: This line displays the text "Available ports:" in the command prompt window.

netstat -an | findstr /R /C:"^ TCP" /C:"^ UDP" /C:"LISTENING": This command executes the netstat command with the -an option, which displays a list of all active connections and listening ports. The output of netstat is then piped to findstr, which searches for lines containing either " TCP", " UDP", or "LISTENING". This filters the output to display only the lines representing TCP and UDP connections as well as the listening ports.
